<h2>Embedded Composer</h2>
<blockquote>
    Composer is a wonderful way to manage a project. But what happens when you
    need your application to be extensible at runtime? Enter Embedded Composer.
    Embedding Composer will ensure that the dependencies already included by
    your application are taken into account when adding additional dependencies
    at runtime. While this can be very useful for any application that may be
    installed globally it is critical for any application that may be
    distributed as a phar.
