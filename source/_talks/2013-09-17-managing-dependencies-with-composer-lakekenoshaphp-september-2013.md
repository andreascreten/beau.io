Traditionally, managing third-party code in PHP projects has not been a trivial task. Fortunately, the PHP community now has [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), a top-notch dependency manager. Learn what Composer is and how you can put it to work for fun and profit. You will see how to set up a new project, find packages, as well as how to create and distribute your own packages.
