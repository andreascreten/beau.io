Does your project rely on third-party code? Does your company share code between multiple projects? If so, you have dealt with dependencies. Traditionally, there have been many ways to manage dependencies for PHP projects: PEAR, copying and pasting, ZIP archives, Subversion exports, Git submodules, or complicated build scripts. Composer, a dependency manager for PHP, aims to make the whole process more streamlined. Learn how Composer can be used to manage third-party packages, how to create and distribute your own Composer packages, and how Composer can change the way you think about code reuse.
