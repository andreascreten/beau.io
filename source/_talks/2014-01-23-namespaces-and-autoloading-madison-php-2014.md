{% block description %}

Want to make sure that your class names don't overwrite the class names for any other projects on the server? Hate having long class names like [insert ridiculously long classname here]? Namespaces were introduced in PHP 5.3 to help address these common issues. Learn how to namespace classes and see how namespaces and class autoloading can make your coding experience much nicer!
